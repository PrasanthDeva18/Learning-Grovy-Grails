What?
Groovy is an object-oriented scripting language for the JVM.
Itâ€™s dynamic (like Python/JavaScript) but also supports static typing (like Java).
Interoperates 100% with Java libraries.
Often used for scripting, DSLs, automation, and frameworks like Grails.

Concise Syntax (less boilerplate than Java).
Dynamic typing (def) + Optional static typing (int, String).
Closures (like lambdas in Java).
Built-in support for Lists, Maps, Ranges, Regex.
Metaprogramming: add methods/properties dynamically.
Builders (e.g., XML, JSON).
Great for scripting, testing, automation, and DSLs.
